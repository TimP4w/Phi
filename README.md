# Î¦ Phi

A dashboard / control plane for FluxCD _heavily_ inspired by [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)'s own dashboard.

This project began as a hands-on experiment with Go and over time, it transformed to this dashboard after some head bashing with flux and my homelab cluster.

__THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY__

I work on it when I have time and feel like it, focusing on what I need, so expect a many bugs, poorly tested, "works on my setup" type of thing (for now?).

# Î¦ Phi

A dashboard for FluxCD _heavily_ inspired by [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/).


This project began as a hands-on experiment with Go and over time, it transformed to this dashboard after some head bashing with flux and my homelab cluster.

This works for my cluster and my setup, however it may struggle with other configurations and versions...


__THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY__

If you want to try it out beware: many bugs are to be expected.
Code is not optimized, nor fully tested.
